Subject: Re:  386 Dhrystones
Status: R

While I don't have the numbers handy, I did (in the past) run Dhrystone
with Turbo C under MS-DOS and with Microport's cc under System V/286.
Turbo C gave about 3580 dhrystones, Microport about 3350. Reg/NoReg
made little difference. I borrowed a recent load of the Intel 386 UNIX
port from the folks down the hall who are certifying it, and ran dhrystone
with that cc. Results were in the low 2000s, approximately a 40% drop
from the 16 bit systems. The whole system felt noticably slower, too.
All this was on a 16MHz Compaq 386 with 2M RAM.
